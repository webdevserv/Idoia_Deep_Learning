The goal is to convert both images into square-sized.  In this module, we saw how to transform into a square by cropping.  This time we will switch to a square by adding space.  If an image is [landscape orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation) you will need to add space at the top and bottom.  Similarly, for portrait (taller than wide), you will add space at the sides.  Make sure that your program centers the image between the space. \n","\n","The following diagram illustrates this.\n","\n","![Image Processing Instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/image-instructions.png \"Image Processing Instructions\")\n","\n","To calculate the color to add to the new space, take the average of all RGB values.  Essentially sum all the red values, green, and blue and divide by the total number of pixels.  Notice how the darker landscape picture above has a darker color added to the above/below space?  This effect is due to this averaging.  Make sure you convert your average RGB to an integer, RGB does not have fractional values.\n","\n","The submit function will check to see if your height and width match my solution.  Your height and width should be square and match my dimensions.  If this is not the case, you likely have a problem with your assignment.  \n","\n","The submit function also takes three pixels and tests them.  Pixels 1 and 3 are the upper left and lower-right; these are the average color and should match my solution exactly. You might see a difference in pixel 2, which is in the center if you center the image differently than I do.  If you want to match my solution, make sure to round to integer after any divisions. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YGYuv0hqkTK1"},"source":["# Google CoLab Instructions\n","\n","If you are using Google CoLab, it will be necessary to mount your GDrive so that you can send your notebook during the submit process.
